[Moonlight for Android](https://moonlight-stream.org) is an open source client for NVIDIA GameStream and [Sunshine](https://github.com/LizardByte/Sunshine).

Moonlight for Android will allow you to stream your full collection of games from your Windows PC to your Android device,
whether in your own home or over the internet.

Moonlight also has a [PC client](https://github.com/moonlight-stream/moonlight-qt) and [iOS/tvOS client](https://github.com/moonlight-stream/moonlight-ios).

You can follow development on our [Discord server](https://moonlight-stream.org/discord) and help translate Moonlight into your language on [Weblate](https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/moonlight/moonlight-android/).
